# Graph-Bridges

## Introduction

Basic implementation that reads a directed graph, finding its <b><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_(graph_theory)'>bridges</a></b> and <b><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articulation_point'>articulation points</a></b>.

## How It Works

The program starts by reading the number of vertices and edges (v e). After obtaining these values, it proceeds to read pairs of vertices representing the edges. The graph is represented using an <b>adjacency list</b>. Then uses a deapth search algorithm to find <b>bridges</b> and <b>articulation points</b>.
